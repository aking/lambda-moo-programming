## Introduction
The primary purpose of this repository is to aggregate and update the existing LambdaMOO Programming Resources that exist. The core of the work done here has been to convert the original MOO Programmer's Manual written by Pavel Curtis to Markdown as well as HTML5 w/ Bootstrap and to update each section of the manual with additional information.

There are a number of other files included in this repository. Many are scraped from various websites that continue to exist, somehow, to this day. Most are at least 15 years old. We have included them here for posterity, since losing them would be tragic.

## Local Setup
```bash
git clone git@github.com:SevenEcks/the-new-moo-programming-guide.git
```

### Markdown Conversion

We use the [html2md](https://github.com/fabianmoronzirfas/to-markdown-cli) library to convert HTML files to markdown on the command line. It can be installed using NPM.

```bash
npm install -g to-markdown-cli
html2md -i ./foo.html -o out.md
```

## Contents
There are two versions of each document in this repository. One is a markdown copy located in [/tutorials](/tutorials) which is accessible on GitHub and one is an HTML version located in [/tutorials/src](/tutorials/src).

### ToastStunt Programmer's Manual
This is an updated Programmer's Manual for ToastStunt (the most cutting edge fork of LambdaMOO). It is a fork of the updated LambdaMOO Manual (see below) which incorpoates the original manual and Todd Sundsted's Stunt updates with regular updates as new features are released for ToastStunt.

[ToastStunt Programmer's Manual](/tutorials/toaststunt-programmers-guide.md)

### Lambda MOO Programmer's Manual [Updated]
This LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual is an **updated an expanded version** of the *LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual* originally written by Pavel Curtis. Some pretty extensive work has gone into formatting it, and updating the content.

#### On The Web
This file is important, and thus, it is available online without having to interact with this GitHub at all: [MOO Programmers Manual](https://www.sindome.org/moo-manual.html)

#### On GitHub
To use this guide you simply need to open [MOO Programmer's Manual](/tutorials/moo-programmers-manual-updated.md). This version of the MOO Programmer's Manual lacks much of the formatting that the HTML5 version below has. It is great for quick perusal, but the HTML version is superior. 

#### Locally

### Server Patches
I've been worried that we might lose some server patches to time. Also they aren't really gathered anywhere on GitHub, just on [LisDude MOO Resources](http://www.lisdude.com/moo/) and random source forge unmainted LambdaMOO repos. So I'm starting to collect them here. If you have any, throw them up in a pull request please!

* [FileIO 1.5p3](patches/fileio-1.5p3) (Todd Sundsted version)

### Server Setup

### Automated Local Environment Setup (Stunt & LambdaCore)
Since I abuse virtual machines for this sort of thing and don't retain the data from them, I have created a repository, [moolite](https://github.com/amnsia/moolite), to reproduce my environment without much typing. It consists of the [Stunt](https://github.com/toddsundsted/stunt) server and the latest LambdaCore database from Brendan's [LambdaMOO](https://github.com/SevenEcks/LambdaMOO) repo. Right now it's a couple of shell scripts, but I will be adding more to it and the quickstart in the README. -- amnsia.

### Useful MOO Code
There are some code samples for enterprising developers to check out. It's limited for now, please feel free to put a pull request in for any code you'd like included.

* [Local Editing](code/LocalEditing.md) (Edit in a pop up window with @edit using Dome-Client web client)
* [Code Scanner](code/CodeScanner.md) (Scan your MOO code for common issues & optimizations)

### Web Client
I've mentioned [Dome Client](https://github.com/JavaChilly/dome-client.js) in the updated MOO Programming Guide. It's a web based MOO client that uses NodeJS and web sockets. It works great, connecting to most LambdaMOO servers. You can run your own. 

#### Public Web Client
Sindome offers a [public web client](http://pubclient.sindome.org/) that can connect to whatever LambdaMOO server you want: http://pubclient.sindome.org/ 

It works great, and if you use the [Local Editing](code/LocalEditing.md) code in this repo, you can write an @edit verb which will let you edit code in a nice pop up window. It's excellent.

## Changes
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Notes
See [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)

## TODO
See [TODO.md](TODO.md)

## Contributing
Please feel free to fork the repo and contribute via pull request. This is a labor of love. Give back to the community. If you want to edit one of the HTML src files, you can do so, but you should run it through html2md (npm install -g to-markdown-cli) and then move the markdown file into the tutorials directory. 

Example of creating a new version of the markdown file from the HTML 5 source and moving to the appropriate folder:

```bash
cd tutorials/src
html2md -i moo-programmers-manual-updated.html -o moo-programmers-manual-updated.md
mv moo-programmers-manual.md ../ 
```

## Author
[Sindome](https://www.sindome.org/) has been online since 1997. I've been playing it since 2003.  I've been developing in MOO since 2005, and a developer on Sindome since 2006. Ours is heavily modified, we have roughly 70-80 players online a lot of time time and dozens of people have developed the game over 20+ year run.  We've got a ton of best practices and design patterns that we implement in order to keep the MOO happy and healthy.  I've attempted to distill as much of that into this document while at the same time present the document in a more up to date format.

Text based gaming is an important part of our history and our future. No game is more accessible to those with handicaps, for example.

Come visit me on Sindome if you dare :)
